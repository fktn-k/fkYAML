# fkYAML
fkYAML is a C++ header-only library to deserialize, serialize and build YAML documents.  
It is also carefully desinged and tested to work with various compilers, C++ standards and platforms.  
So, if you want portability & development speed-up, fkYAML is the way to go.  
You can add YAML support into your projects by just including the header file(s).  
This simple example deserializes a YAML string into a document, make simple modifications, and finally serializes the modified documentation to a YAML string.  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <fkYAML/node.hpp>

int main() {
    // 1. deserialize a YAML string into a document.
    //    The input can be other container types or their iterators.
    //    `deserialize` accepts `FILE*`, `std::istream` as well.
    std::string yaml = R"(
project: fkYAML
required C++ version: 11
works on:
  - Linux
  - macOS
)";
    auto node = fkyaml::node::deserialize(yaml);

    // 2. Modify it.
    //    `fkyaml::node::sequence_type` is `std::vector<fkyaml::node>`.
    node["maintainer"] = "fktn-k";
    node.at("works on").get_value_ref<fkyaml::node::sequence_type&>()
                       .emplace_back("Windows");

    // 3. serialize the modified document to a YAML string and save it.
    std::ofstream ofs("out.yaml");
    ofs << node;
  
    // Contents of out.yaml
    //
    // maintainer: fktn-k
    // project: fkYAML
    // required C++ version: 11
    // works on:
    //   - Linux
    //   - macOS
    //   - Windows
}
```

## Design Goals
There are a lot of YAML libraries written in C/C++ out there, and each may have its reasons to exist.  
fkYAML has been developed with these design goals:  

### :briefcase: **Portable**  
The library depends only on C++ standards, and is carefully designed to work on many platforms so that fkYAML can be imported into existing C++ projects written in C++11 or better.  
No external dependencies, no sub-projects, and no additional compiler flags are required.  
Although fkYAML is a library with multiple header files by default, you can use [the single-header version](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/single_include/fkYAML/node.hpp). You can further use [fkyaml_fwd.hpp](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/single_include/fkYAML/fkyaml_fwd.hpp) for forward declarations.  
Furthermore, the project supports [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and provides [the documentation exclusively for CMake integration](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/tutorials/cmake_integration).  
Those characteristics allow existing C++ project using CMake for builds to quickly incorporate YAML support with just a little effort.  

### :memo: **Well Documented**  
[The documentation](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/) provides plenty of information so that users can understand what fkYAML is and what they can achieve with fkYAML.  
For instance, [the tutorial pages](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/tutorials/) show how you can read/write/customize using fkYAML to handle YAML documents while creating a simple C++ project using CMake.  
Also, [API reference pages](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/) provide more detailed, exclusive descriptions with example usages for each fkYAML API.  

### :mag: **Heavily Tested**  
fkYAML has been [unit-tested](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/tree/develop/test/unit_test) and its test suite covers 100% of lines and conditions of the codebase. (You can see the actual coverage [here](https://coveralls.io/github/fktn-k/fkYAML?branch=develop).)  
We check with [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org) and the [Clang Sanitizers](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html) that there are no runtime issues such as memory leak.  
Furthermore, the quality of our codebase has been checked with [Clang-Tidy](https://releases.llvm.org/14.0.0/tools/clang/tools/extra/docs/clang-tidy/index.html), [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/) and [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/).  
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflows run against every commit pushed on the main & develop branches to ensure that the fkYAML library can be successfully built/tested with a variety of compilers, operating systems and C++ standards.  
See the [supported compilers](#supported-compilers) section for more details.

## Features

* General
    * Cross-platforms
        * Compilers: GCC, Clang, Visual Studio, etc.
        * Operating systems: Linux, macOS, Windows.
    * Easy integration
        * Header-only library. Just copy the headers to your project. CMake packages are also available in [the release page](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/releases/latest).
    * Self-contained, minimal dependencies
        * The C++ standard is the only dependency. No external dependencies, sub-projects or additional compiler flags are required.
* YAML Standard Compliance (with [the YAML specification v1.2.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/))
    * YAML syntax
        * Support scalars, sequences, mappings in both block and flow styles.
            * Sequences and mappings are accepted as mapping keys in de/serialization. Such a key can also be passed to query a mapping value like [`operator[]`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/operator[]/) or [`at`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/at/).
            * Values can be referenced by [`get_value_ref`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/get_value_ref/) or converted to arbitrary types by [`get_value`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/get_value/) or [`get_value_inplace`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/get_value_inplace/).
            * Empty mapping keys like `: value` or `- : value` are NOT supported.
        * Support `%TAG` and `%YAML` directives
            * `%YAML` directives have no effect and YAML 1.2 is always assumed.
            * Any unknown directives are just ignored during deserialization.
        * Support tags, anchors and aliases
        * Support de/serializing a single document by [`deserialize`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/deserialize/) and [`serialize`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/serialize/).
        * Support de/serializing multiple documents in input stream as well by [`deserialize_docs`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/deserialize_docs/) and [`serialize_docs`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/deserialize_docs/).
    * Encodings
        * Support UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, including both little and big endians.
            * Character types are `char` for all the above encodings, `char8_t`(since C++20) for UTF-8, `char16_t` for UTF-16 and `char32_t` for UTF-32.
        * Support automatic detection of encodings in input stream.
            * The first character should be a BOM or an ASCII character as described in [the specification](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#52-character-encodings).
            * Otherwise, the UTF-8 encoding is assumed.
        * Support encoding validation internally.
        * A Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of input stream is automatically consumed during deserialization. Any BOMs at the other places are treated as contents.
    * Line break formats
        * Support the Unix style `\n` and the Windows style `\r\n` for deserialization.
        * Serialization uses the Unix style `\n`. No configuration is available for now.
* Customization Points
    * Node value types
        * Scalars, sequences and mappings are all stored in [`fkyaml::node`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/node/) objects as `bool` for booleans, `int64_t` for integers, `double` for floating point values, `std::string` for strings, `std::vector<fkyaml::basic_node>` for sequences and `std::map<fkyaml::basic_node, fkyaml::basic_node>` for mappings.  
        The types to use for storage are customizable to your needs by changing template parameter types of [`fkyaml::basic_node`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/).
    * Arbitrary type conversions
        * fkYAML has a number of built-in conversion functions from/to [`fkyaml::basic_node`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/) for a lot of STL container/scalar types.  
        You can implement your own [`from_node`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/node_value_converter/from_node/) and [`to_node`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/node_value_converter/to_node/) functions for types which are defined by your project or third party projects.  
        See [the tutorial page](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/tutorials/) for details.
* Miscellaneous
    * [fkyaml_fwd.hpp](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/single_include/fkYAML/fkyaml_fwd.hpp) is available for forward declarations of fkYAML APIs so unnecessary definitions will not slow down compilation.
    * Some features introduced in C++14 and better are available depending on the active C++ standard at compile time, for examples:
        * [Structured binding](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/structured_binding) support for mappings.
        * [std::string_view](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view) for input stream.
        * [std::optional](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional) for conversions from node values.

More detailed descriptions are to be found on [GitHub Pages](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML).

Although [rapidyaml](https://github.com/biojppm/rapidyaml) is about 2x faster with immutable buffers and far faster with mutable buffers than fkYAML as it focuses on high performance, fkYAML is in general 70% faster than [libfyaml](https://github.com/pantoniou/libfyaml) and also about 6.5x faster than [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp).  
Note that, since fkYAML deserializes scalars into native booleans or integers during the parsing, the performance could be more faster in some use cases since there is no need for string manipulations upon data queries.
