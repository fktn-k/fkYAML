# How to contribute

Thank you for visiting the fkYAML project. If you make any contribution for this project, it will surely be some help for us and other users in the future.  

To make it as easy as possible for you to contribute and for me to keep an overview, here are a few guidelines which should help us avoid all kinds of unnecessary work or disappointment. And of course, this document itself is subject to discussion, so please [create a discussion](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/discussions) or a pull request if you find a way to improve it!

## Private reports

Usually, all issues are tracked publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/issues). If you want to make a private report (e.g., for a vulnerability or to attach an example that is not meant to be published), please send an email to <fktn.dev@gmail.com>.

## Describe your request/issue

Please create a [discussion](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/issues/new/choose), assuming one does not already exist, and describe your concern.  
Note you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) for this.

Please keep in mind the followings:
- If you propose a change or addition, try to give an **example** how the improved code could look like or how to use it.
- If you find a bug, please describe how to **reproduce** it. If possible, attach a complete example which demonstrates the error. Please also state what you **expected** to happen instead of the error.
- If you find a compilation error, please tell us which **compiler** (version and operating system) you used and paste the (relevant part of) the error messages to the ticket.

For questions, feature or support requests, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/discussions/new).  

## Contribution Steps

Basically, follow [the contribution guideline](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) in the GitHub Docs.  
To make changes to the fkYAML project, you need to edit the following files:

### 1. [`include/fkYAML/**.hpp`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/tree/develop/include/fkYAML)

These files are the sources of the fkYAML library and **DO NOT** directly change the files under the [`single_include`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/tree/develop/single_include/) directory. Alghough amalgamation is automatically executed in the GitHub Actions workflows, you can run the script ([`run_amalgamation.bat`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/scripts/run_amalgamation.bat) for Windows, [`run_amalgamation.sh`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/scripts/run_amalgamation.sh) otherwise) to regenerate [`single_include/fkYAML/node.hpp`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/single_include/fkYAML/node.hpp) and [`single_include/fkYAML/fkyaml_fwd.hpp`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/single_include/fkYAML/fkyaml_fwd.hpp) locally, which will save us from waiting unnecessarily long for the workflow results.  

**Windows (Command Prompt)**
```batch
cd path\to\fkYAML
scripts\run_amalgamation.bat
```

**Otherwise**
```bash
cd path/to/fkYAML
scripts/run_amalgamation.sh
```

If you just want to check if amalgamation is needed locally, run the script ([`check_amalgamation.bat`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/scripts/check_amalgamation.bat) for Windows, [`check_amalgamation.sh`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/scripts/check_amalgamation.sh) otherwise) with the following commands:  

**Windows (Command Prompt)**
```batch
cd path\to\fkYAML
scripts\check_amalgamation.bat
```

**Otherwise**
```bash
cd path/to/fkYAML
scripts/check_amalgamation.sh
```

### 2. [`test/unit_test/*.cpp`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/tree/develop/test/unit_test)

These files contain the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) unit tests from which current coverage data is generated. (Click [here](https://coveralls.io/github/fktn-k/fkYAML) to see the current coverage of the library's code.) If you have added or changed a feature, please also modify a unit test to the associated file(s) to keep covering 100% of the lines/branches in the fkYAML library.  

The unit tests can be compiled and executed with the following commands:  

```bash
cd path/to/fkYAML
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DFK_YAML_BUILD_TEST=ON [-DFK_YAML_USE_SINGLE_HEADER=(ON|OFF)]
cmake --build build --config Debug
ctest -C Debug --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Furthermore, you can test the single-header version of fkYAML by passing `-DFK_YAML_USE_SINGLE_HEADER=ON` when you configure CMake. (disabled by default)  

#### Check the coverage locally

In the GitHub Action workflows, test coverage information is generated with the [LCOV](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) tool.  
The same file as uploaded to the Coveralls and its HTML version (generated by `genhtml`) can be downloaded from the link in the autogenerated message from the bot per push event.  

You might want to check the coverage locally before creating a PR, for example, to ensure that the coverage remains still after you change the library sources.  
In such cases, please run the following commands and open a generated `index.html` file in the `<repo_root>/build_coverage/html` directory to check the result.  
Make sure `lcov` and `genhtml` commands are available before execution.  

```bash
cd /path/to/fkYAML
make html-coverage
```

##### For Windows users (help needed)

I currently don't know the way in which the dependent commands, `lcov` and `genhtml`, are run on the "pure" Windows platform, neither using [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) nor [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).  
Until such a way is found, I recommend you use WSL2 or other similar means where you can run a Linux environment on Windows.  
If you have an idea to run those tools on the "pure" Windows platform, please open a discussion or a PR to share it with the other Windows users.  

### 3. [`docs/mkdocs/docs/**.md`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/tree/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs)

These files are the sources of the documentation from which [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) generates the documentation. If you have added or changed a feature, please also add sufficient descriptions so that the documentation is kept up-to-date.  

Also, you can build & check the updated documentation on your local environment by executing the following commands:

```bash
cd path/to/fkYAML
make -C docs/mkdocs serve
```

The commands above will automatically install all the dependencies using [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/venv.html) with the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt) file. The generated documentation will be available by accessing http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

### 4. Format source files

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/actions) will test the updated project with the [Clang-Format](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-18.1.3) tool (18.1.3) once you open a PR or push commits afterwards which include changes in the source files under either [`include`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/tree/develop/include) or [`test`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/tree/develop/test) directories.  
Although code formatting is automatically executed in the GitHub Actions workflows, you can run the script files ([`run_clang_format.bat`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/scripts/run_clang_format.bat) for Windows, [`run_clang_format.sh`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/scripts/run_clang_format.sh) otherwise) to check if your changes follow the rules defined in the [`.clang-format`](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/.clang-format) file on your local environment in advance.  
Note that, since the Clang-Format tool does not gurantee backward compatibility especially in its edge cases and its behaviors might therefore vary from version to version, it's highly recommended that you use the above script files to avoid unnecessary confusion for that kind of reason.  
The scripts uses [the Clang-Format Python distribution](https://pypi.org/project/clang-format/18.1.3/) and installs it using [the Python venv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) if it's not been installed yet.  
You can run the scripts with the following commands:  

**Windows (Command Prompt)**
```batch
cd path\to\fkYAML
scripts\run_clang_format.bat
```

**Otherwise**
```bash
cd path/to/fkYAML
scripts/run_clang_format.sh
```

## Note

When you open a pull request, fkYAML will automatically be built/tested with (1) various combinations of compilers and operating systems and (2) analyzers such as [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) and [Clang Sanitizers](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html) to detect runtime issues (e.g., memory leaks), on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/actions) once you open a pull request.  
These can result in failing builds and/or unit tests which run successfully on your local environment.  
As a policy of this project, however, all the workflow checks must be passed before merging.  
You can run tests with those tools locally by executing the following commands:  

**Valgrind** (assuming Valgrind is already installed.)
```bash
cd path/to/fkYAML
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DFK_YAML_BUOLD_TEST=ON -DFK_YAML_RUN_VALGRIND=ON
cmake --build build --config Debug
ctest -C Debug -T memcheck --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

**Clang Sanitizers** (assuming some version of Clang is already installed.)
```bash
cd path/to/fkYAML
CXX=clang++ cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DFK_YAML_BUILD_TEST=ON -DFK_YAML_RUN_CLANG_SANITIZERS=ON
cmake --build build --config Debug
ctest -C Debug --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Please don't

- The C++11 support varies between different **compilers** and versions. Please note the [list of supported compilers](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/blob/develop/README.md#supported-compilers). Some compilers like GCC 4.7 (and earlier), Clang 3.3 (and earlier), or Microsoft Visual Studio 13.0 (and earlier) are known not to work due to missing or incomplete C++11 support. Please refrain from proposing changes that work around these compiler's limitations with `#ifdef`s or other means.
- Please refrain from proposing changes that would **break [YAML](https://yaml.org/) specifications**. If you propose a conformant extension of YAML to be supported by the library, please motivate this extension.
- Please do not open pull requests that address **multiple issues**.

## Help Wanted

The following areas really need contribution:

- Extending the **continuous integration** to support more compilers, platforms, package managers, and/or operating systems, such as Android NDK, Intel's Compiler, or 32bit operating systems.
- Introducing **benchmarks** to measure the processing cost of this library. Though efficiency is not everything, speed and memory consumption are very important characteristics for C++ developers. So, having proper comparisons would be reasonable for both contributors and users.
