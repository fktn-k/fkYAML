### Summary
This release adds new features: parsing multi-line plain scalars & reverse iterations over sequence/mapping node elements.  
See the related pull requests and documentations for more details.  

A number of bugs (mostly in the deserialization feature) have also been resolved.  
Note that a breaking change has been made in the way of error handling when deserializing an int or float scalar fail. The library now emits no error on such a scalar and treats it as a string scalar instead.

### What's Changed

#### :boom: Breaking Changes
- Stop throwing parse\_error on string-to-int/float conversion failures if not forced with tag ([\#431](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/431), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
  - reported by [tomwpid](https://github.com/tomwpid) in the issue [\#428](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/issues/428)
  - The library used to throw a `fkyaml::parse_error` upon conversion failures from a scalar to an integer or floating point value while parsing a YAML like this:  
    ```yaml
    id: 6E-578 # "6E-578" is interpreted as a floating point value but not expressible as a `double`
               # --> `fkyaml::parse_error` gets thrown due to the conversion failure.
    ```
  - Such a conversion failure is now internally recovered by treating the scalar as a string scalar instead.  

#### :sparkles: New Features
- Support parsing multiline plain scalars ([\#432](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/432), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
  - Parsing a YAML which contains multi-line plain (unquoted) scalars are now supported.  
    ```yaml
    foo: this is 
      a multi-line
        plain scalar # interpreted as "this is a multi-line plain scalar"
    ```
- Support reverse iterations over sequence/mapping nodes ([\#440](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/440), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
  - You can now iterate over sequence/mapping elements in a reversed order like this:  
    ```cpp
    // node is [1, 2, 3]
    for (auto rit = node.rbegin(); rit != node.rend(); ++rit) {
        std::cout << *rit << std::endl;
    }
    
    // output:
    // 3
    // 2
    // 1
    ```

#### :zap: Improvements
- Resolve the C4800 warning when compiled with MSVC ([\#430](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/430), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
  - reported by [tomwpid](https://github.com/tomwpid) in the issue [\#429](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/issues/429)
- Make node iterators compatible with different value type const-ness ([\#438](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/438), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
  - `fkyaml::node::iterator` and `fkyaml::node::const_iterator` are compatible in constructions, assignments and comparisons.  

#### :bug: Bug Fixes
- Emit error if an anchor is specified to an alias ([\#434](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/434), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
- Fixed bugs in parsing block scalars ([\#435](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/435), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
- Fix parsing input which begins with a newline & indentation ([\#437](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/437), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
- Fix round-trip issue in float serialization using scientific notation ([\#439](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/439), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
  - reported by [dyerbod](https://github.com/dyerbod) in the issue [\#405](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/issues/405)

#### :robot: CI
- Update GitHub Actions workflow jobs using macOS related runner images ([\#433](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/433), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))
- Add more GCC & Clang versions to use in GitHub Actions workflows ([\#436](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/436), [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k))

### Summary
This release adds the new header file *fkyaml_fwd.hpp* which provides the library's namespace macros and forward declarations of the library's API classes. With the file, you can reduce the compile time cost of including the full library header if some source files do not actually use the library features.  
Furthermore, conversions of YAML nodes into arbitrary types have been much improved and a lot more STL container and scalar types have been supported for that purpose. See [the API documentation page](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/get_value/) for more details.  
Other changes are related to minor bug fixes in YAML scalar parsing and maintenance fixes for CI.

    * [node.hpp](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/releases/download/v0.3.12/node.hpp) (single header)

### Summary

This release adds some basic_node APIs to get/set node attributes for more secure backwards compatibilities in future releases. Because of that, some existing APIs have been deprecated (see the list down below). It's recommended for users to replace deprecated API usages with new APIs.  
Furthermore, relatively large refactoring has been made for better performance and more flexible node attribute configurations (just preparation for now, but will be added within a few coming releases). As a result, deserialization performance has increased. See the Benchmarking section in README.md for details.  
Last but not least, several bugs have also been resolved in deserialization, and active C++ standard is now correctly detected at compile time when using MSVC compilers where `__cplusplus` macro doesn't hold a correct value by default.  

#### :sparkles: New Features

- Add node\_type/yaml\_version\_type enum class APIs by [fktn-k](https://github.com/fktn-k) in [\#388](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/388)
  - In this PR, the following APIs has been deprecated. Although they still work as before except for compile-time deprecation warnings, it's highly recommended to replace their usages with new APIs since they are planned to be removed in v0.4.0. See the Deprecation notes in each deprecated API reference page for migration guides.

### Summary

This release adds the new support for deserializing/serializing multiple YAML documents by adding new APIs ([`fkyaml::node::deserialize_docs()`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/deserialize_docs/) and [`fkyaml::node::serialize_docs()`](https://fktn-k.github.io/fkYAML/api/basic_node/serialize_docs/) respectively). You can still call the existing APIs for deserializing/serializing a single YAML document. See the linked API document pages for details.  
In addition, from this version on, Intel icpx compiler is supported and used in the CI processes. Some compiler flags are added in building the unit testing app, but no compiler specific swiches are required for the library itself.  
Moreover, because the GitHub Actions runner image for macOS11 has been deprecated, the CI jobs which uses the runner image and some compiler support which depend on the runner image have been removed.  
For other changes like bug fixes, see descriptions in each related issues and PRs.

### Summary

This release contains the new support of multiline scalars in the deserialization feature.  
As described in the PR [\#344](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/pull/344), the support is limited to single/double quoted styles and multiline scalar keys are being permitted as opposed to the YAML specification.  
The above limitations will, of course, be resolved in future releases.  
Furthermore, a number of bugs in the deserialization feature have been resolved as shown in the Bug Fixes section down below.  
Last but not least, gcc14 and clang18 have been added to the supported compilers list and are now used in the GitHub Actions workflows for testing.

    * [fkYAML.zip](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/releases/download/v0.2.0/fkYAML.zip)

### Summary

This release contains a breaking change in the default type for YAML mapping node: it will no longer preserve insertion order of internal key/value pairs by default.  
To preserve the insertion order as it used to, use `fkyaml::ordered_map` as `basic_node`'s mapping node type.  
Furthermore, factory methods for scalar values of `basic_node` type have been removed and unified into the `basic_node` constructors.  
Along with the above changes, internal operations in the fkYAML have also been improved regarding conversions between YAML nodes and values of native data types.  

!!! warning CAVEAT

    The fkYAML library is an alpha quality software, at most.  
    It would take a while until this library gets stabled version, since implementation and maintenance has been/will be done by a single developer.  
    If you find a bug or wanted features, please open a discussion/issue to let me know.

## **fkYAML v0.0.0**

This release provides basic features of the fkYAML library.  
Major known issues and limitaions are as follows:  

- %TAG directives are not supported. (Will surely be implemented.)
- YAML key must be a string literal. (YAML specification of any version does not restrict YAML keys as such.)
- Backward compatibilities for YAML 1.1 or older have not yet been implemented.

The other issues and limitations will also be fixed in later versions.  
Wait for such a version, or create a PR to fix one.
